				Bogalake, an inscriptive endowment of beauty and pleasure at Bandarban, Bangladesh
			</p></br>
			<p>
				Nature lovers always feel a thirst inside for beauty, thrill and enchantment. And the holy nature has bestowed Bangladesh with an overwhelming and unparallel creature which is publicly known as Boga Lake. Bogalake is considered as a source of wonder, unlimited beauty and adventure for the nature`s lovers and travelers. So Boga Lake is waiting with its unique beauty for those adventurous travelers who just not only want to satisfy their eyes with artificial and tedious natural beauties but also want to fill their heart with eternal joy and thrill to innovate their restless mind. And it has emerged like a holy duty of the travelers and tourists to visit the Boga Lake as soon as possible to highlight the beauty with thrill.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				The origin of the name Boga lake is derived from some domestic mythological stories. The word Boga is derived from the local word Baga which means a dragon or fire. Actually some super natural stories flame the fire about the lake being the accommodation of an ancient dragon indeed and that concludes the story of the identification of Boga lake
			</p></br>
			<p>
				Anthropologists define Boga lake as 2000 year old hill enclaved natural lake of Bandarban,Bangladesh. Boga lake is accompanied with deep bamboo bushes from its three sides wich are bounded by mountain peaks. Again, Boga lake is recognized as the highest natural lake of Bangladesh which is approximately 1500 ft above the sea level. Boga lake has a rectangular shap either funnel shape.

But usually the lake water shows its extra –ordinary crystal clear mirror view of blue shade which reflects like pearls and more than enough to astonish a tourist guy.
			</p></br>

				It is easy to imagine for the common people that almost 1500 ft above sea level and unfavorable natural area of Boga lake has made it without any existence of human community or barren area indeed.
