			<h2>Traditional</h2></br>
			<p>
				The rest of the world may have their blast of New Year in January 1st. But for us, the advent of Bengali New Year (Pahela Baishakh; April 14 of each year) is the most cheerful, colorful and amazing public holiday that is immensely observed throughout the country. From urban concrete jungle to blissful natural rural landscape, the unbound color of life will definitely mesmerize you. It is presumed that the tradition of Pahela Baishakh started about 600 years back. One of the chief customaries of Pahela Baishakh is clearing up all the dues of present year on the last day of Chaitra (the twelfth month of the Bengali calendar). On the first day of Bengali new year, the landlords or the shop owners offer sweets to their tenants and customers.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				In Dhaka, under the Banyan Tree at Ramna park, the biggest and most colorful celebration of Pahela Baishakh takes place. The programme initiates with Tagore’s famous song titled “Eso he Baishakh eso eso” (Come O Baishakh, come come) performed by the artists of Chhayanat. The students and teachers of Institute of Fine Arts bring out a colorful procession and parade around their campus with sculptures that resemble our age old culture. With wearing traditional attires, hundreds of Bangladeshi people join both events. Every media channel — based Bangladesh — broadcast a live coverage on both of this programme. The newspapers also publishes special news and supplements following this event.
			</p>
			<h2>Dubla Rash Mela</h2></br>
			<p>
				Dubla Rash Mela is the biggest fair in not only Bagerhat, but also the entire Bangladesh. This has become a grand occasion for many foreign tourists visiting the Sundarbans and people come from India as well. At the centre of the festival are twenty thousand temporary fishermen who are engaged in catching and drying fish on Dubla and nearby islands. In the Bangla month of Agrahayan every year, the fair continues for 5-7 days during full moon time.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				Dubla Island is situated on the Bay of Bengal as a part of the Sunderbans forest. Initiated by Hari Bhajan, a disciple of Thakur hari Chand, this fair was first organized in 1923 during the Rash Purnima. To continue his legacy and keep his memory alive, the devotees — especially the fisherman of the Sunderbans — organize this five-day fair. Around 40-50 thousand people join the celebrations every year. Traditional handicrafts, precious wooden items, foods etc are put on sale.
			</p>
			<h2>Shakrain Festival </h2></br>
			<p>
				Celebrated especially in Old Dhaka, Shakrain Festival (also known as Kite Festival) is observed at the end of the Bengali month Poush or January 14 or 15. This is day is also known as Poush Shangkranti. The major attraction of this festival is that people of all ages gather around their rooftop with their kites in the afternoon. They fly their kites high and sometimes this festival often brings the epic and exciting kite fighting. Each participant attempts to snag each other’s kite. At the night, people crack their fireworks in a way to light up the sky of old Dhaka. This gets even more exciting with the flame-eaters skills of fire show.
			</p>
			<h2>Lalon Mela</h2></br>
			<p>
				Lalon Shah is one of most acclaimed and prominent philosopher from Bangladesh. His distinctive tradition of philosophy is still being carried out through thousands of songs and composition which he wrote during his lifetime. His vision on human life is the fundamental base of Baul culture and tradition which is now currently appreciated and studied by major researchers all over the world.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				Every year on the first week of April, a fair is organized following Lalon Shah’s birth anniversary by the devotees. The fair is held at the akhra (the place where Lalon lived) situated in Kushtia. The entire place goes through colorful decoration on this occasion. Thousands devotees from both abroad and Bangladesh gather in the Akhra to celebrate this day. With ektara and other musical instrument, the singers of Lalon Academy perform Lalon’s song all through the night during this fair. With the hymn of thousands unique composition, the devotees from all around the world remember the veracity of his philosophical thoughts.
