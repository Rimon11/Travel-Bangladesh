			<h2>Geography and Climate</h2></br>
			<p>
				Bangladesh is a “Land of Stories”. Everything of this land tells a story; a story of Bangladeshi people and their heart. Not only the livelihood of Bangladeshi people is deeply rooted in this land, but also their life is deeply incorporated in this lands.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				This country has a very fertile alluvial soil which gives the country abundant crops every year. These lands are like our parents, our eternal guardian who take cares of us, nurture us with providing our primitive needs. With a grand and resourceful Bay of Bengal at its south, Bangladesh is called the land of rivers. As a riverine country, about 700 rivers including tributaries flow through the country in which the souls and livelihood of Bangladeshi people are strongly connected. Like so many songs and poems — which are written specially to celebrate these rivers — the majestically curvy banks or the turbulent tide of Bangladeshi rivers give the people hope and an excitement to live the best out of it. Apart from these rivers, the country also have plenty of haors, baor, jheel, beel which strengthens our relation with more affection.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				Covered with diversified natural wonders and wildlife, this country sees a wide range of Hills in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the southeast and Sylhet division in the northeast. What make these areas more interesting and exotic are the tribal people inhabited here for a long period of time. The Sundarbans — home of the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger — are the largest littoral mangrove forest in the world as well as the most important and the biggest forest of Bangladesh. This land is the safest sanctuary for a diverse range of wildlife.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				The careless look of amazing deer, a rare glimpse or a sudden terrifying roar or even footprints of Royal Bengal Tiger on the swampy land of Sundarbans, hiking against the bushy and thick jungles of Sundarbans etc will completely satisfy any adventure seekers. Yes. Apart from some epic storytelling natural lands, the growing urban landscapes manifest the truly blend of modern and traditional setting of Bangladesh too. With rising architectural wonders and topnotch urban facility the country has its major urban areas in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Sylhet. Even in these urbanized areas, you will find some archeological heritages which will constantly remind us about our traditional and cultural root. If you have been mesmerized by the stories of our rural, hilly and watery land, then you should also be amazed by the urban wonders.
