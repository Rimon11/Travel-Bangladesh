			<h2>Folk Songs</h2></br>
			<p>

			</p></br>
			<p>
				Legendary lyricists like Lalon Shah, Hason Raja, Kangal Harinath, Romesh Shill, Abbas Uddin, and many unknown anonymous lyricists have enriched the tradition of folk songs of Bangladesh. And Robindro Shongit and Nazrul Giti are also upholding our cultural heritage in modern context.
			</p>
			<h2>Dance</h2></br>
			<p>
				Dance is a form of expression that enables our entire physical body to mingle with our soul. Our soul celebrates our existence through our body. With hundreds of variations like katthak, dhali, baul, manipuri, snake dances, classical, non-classical etc. our dance holds a dominant position in our Bangladeshi culture.
			</p>
			<h2>Drama</h2></br>
			<p>
				Drama is one of the oldest form of performances arts that has been popularized in both urban and rural areas. In the urban areas, like in Dhaka, there are dozens of theatre groups who have been regularly staging locally written or plays written by famous writers of other countries which are usually adopted or translated. Popular theatre groups are Dhaka Theatre, Nagarik Nattya Sampraday and Theatre. Even street drama is gradually becoming a popular form of drama.
			</p></br>
			<p>
				Jatra or folk drama is one the most significant divisions of Bangladeshi culture. Mostly themed around mythological stories that deals with love and tragedy, stories that depicts the heroism and virtues, jatra is not only a popular means of entertainment in rural areas, but also it holds a significant position to our culture that identifies our devotion and artistic passion towards art.
			</p>
			<h2>Tribal</h2></br>
			<p>
				Our tribal music and dance is as significant as our mainstream culture. They are of indigenous origin and also rooted with the Bangladeshi soil as much as any kind of Bangladeshi culture. Each tribe has its own dance and music numbers with their unique ways of expressing the spiritual being. Among the tribal dances, Monipuri and Santal are popular.
